What is Confusion Matrix in Machine Learning

Not only human beings but also the machine learning models may get confused !! After all Artificial Intelligence mimics a human brain, isn’t it?(pun intended). Imagine yourself as a machine learning engineer and suppose you trained a machine learning classification model successfully today. After the model is trained you checked the accuracy which is 93.0%. Wow you are so happy!!
